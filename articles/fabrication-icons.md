## A New Era of Fabrication: A Fresh Perspective on the Icon

Fabrication, the art of creating intricate forms from basic components, has undergone a remarkable transformation, expanding its reach beyond traditional factories to encompass homes, libraries, and labs. While the industry's evolution is undeniable, its iconic representation, the 'old factory,' remains unchanged, failing to capture the essence of modern fabrication practices.

As we embark on a journey to transform P3 into a digital fabrication hub, the need for a simple, intuitive, standard, and customizable icon has become paramount. To address this, we propose a new symbol that embodies the essence of fabrication: an isometric cube with a missing or displaced cell.

This minimalistic yet evocative design captures the fundamental principle of fabrication â€“ the assembly of complex structures from fundamental units. The missing cell represents the transformative process, hinting at the creation of something new from existing elements.

To signify the advent of digital fabrication, we can modify the icon by incorporating the concept of pixelization. This symbolizes the digitalization that has permeated the fabrication landscape, akin to the fourth industrial revolution's impact on manufacturing.

The assembly process can be depicted by either reintroducing the missing cell with its outline visible or by simply offsetting it, emphasizing the act of putting the pieces together.

The versatility of this new fabrication icon lies in its adaptability. Designers and users can tailor it to specific contexts and industries while preserving its core elements. It's an icon that honors the legacy of traditional manufacturing while embracing the digital revolution shaping the future.

Here are a few examples of how the icon can be customized:

- A metal fabrication company could incorporate a metal texture into the icon.
- A wood fabrication company could incorporate a wood texture into the icon.
- A 3D printing company could incorporate a 3D-printed texture into the icon.
- A digital fabrication company could incorporate a pixelized texture into the icon.

The icon can also be used to represent different stages of the fabrication process. For instance:

- A red cell could indicate a missing cell, symbolizing the design phase.
- A yellow cell could indicate a cell under fabrication, representing the fabrication phase.
- A green cell could indicate a completed cell, representing the assembly phase.

The possibilities are limitless!

We believe this new fabrication icon, with its simplicity, intuitiveness, standardization, and customizability, aptly represents the future of fabrication. It's a symbol that embodies the transformative power of fabrication, bridging the gap between traditional practices and the digital revolution.
